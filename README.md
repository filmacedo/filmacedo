Hi, I’m Filipe Macedo.

I’m building Talent Protocol, the resume for the new internet.

Before that, I spent 10+ years building digital-first brands for early stage startups and corporate clients like Nike, L’Oréal or Danone.

I'm a computer engineer by training, but a maker and marketer by heart.

I enjoy street photography by day, mixing music by night, and playing basketball whenever I can. My home is in Lisbon, but I work async and travel often.
